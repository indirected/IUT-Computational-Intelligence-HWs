# Computational Intelligence HWs
Every Homework and/or Project that I have done for the computational intelligence course at IUT.

---

## Homework 1: 

Some Theoretical Linear and Logistic Regression / Neural Networks Questions.

---

## Homework 2: Logistic Regression from scratch / Pytorch NN

Some concepts included in this homework:

* Data Preparation / Normalization / Up or Down Sampling
* K-Fold Cross Validation
* Implementing Logistic Regression from Scratch
* Implementing MLP using PyTorch
* Overfitting and Regularization

## Homework 3: Fashion MNIST CNN / Transfer Learning
In this Project we have implemented a CNN for the fashion MNIST dataset and we have achieved high and acceptable results. In the second part, we have used a a pre-trained feature extractor model called EfficientNet B3 in two different setups of weight-freeze and weight-tuning.

Some concepts included in this Project:

* Convolution Neural Networks
* Pytorch Datasets / Models / DataLoaders
* Pytorch Custom Modules
* Transfer Learning
* Hyper-parameter Tuning using the wandb.ai Sweep
